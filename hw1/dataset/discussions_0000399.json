This Times Square property lacked the usual welcome. Its garish, deafening music 'living room' led to the elevators and my room. A lovely view of the windows of the adjaecent office buidling. The climate control did not work in the room, front desk explained the two-pipe system could not be adjusted and setting for cool just brought more hot air. I roasted and could not sleep. The servers were rude at breakfast and I skipped it running late. The hotel manager offer me some minor hotel point compensation, which I refused as not good enough, but he posted them anyway as this gesture ended the matter for the hotel.
