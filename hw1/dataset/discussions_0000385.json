In 3 of our rooms things were stolen. From one room, we noticed our luggage was moved and we missed 200 pounds. The day after, 50 pounds was missing of one of our friend's room, and from another room some necklaces and earings. We contacted the staff about this and Marco, who presented himself as one of the managers, said he would put his hand on fire for his team and that it would be impossible that someone would steal anything from our rooms. He did even suggested that we could have lost our things or maybe borrowed our keys to someone of our own group. It was offensive! We registered a complaint in the police, and then the staff of the hotel said they would investigate it. No one contacted us so far. Our stay would be ok if none of these things had happened. The room is ok. The bed is ok. But what happened unacceptable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T21:34:47.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
