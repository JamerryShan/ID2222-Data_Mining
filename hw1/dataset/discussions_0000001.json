{"text": "There is a lot to like about this keyboard. It is smooth and silent.  adjusting to the actuation point is smooth and zero phantom strokes. The build quality feels like a keyboard in the price range. The wrist wrest is comfortable and fatigue is next to nothing. The optical switches are great for gaming and while it is not clicky, adjusting to the actuation point is smooth and zero phantom strokes. I am surprised and pleased this e-reader is easy on my eyes. the warm light does make a difference. I balked at giving up my old simple kindle."}
