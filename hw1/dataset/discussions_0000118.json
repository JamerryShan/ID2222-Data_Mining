The room didn't look anything like the one shown on Booking.com it was a lot smaller. The bathroom was very small, probably the smallest I have ever uncounted, nowhere to put toiletries. There was no mirror over the dressing table, just a mirror near the room door with no power socket, so my wife had nowhere to do her hair. The tea and coffee was in the wardrobe on a tray with no power, so had to find somewhere to place with a socket, of which there was only one available on the dressing table, now no space on dressing table. On check out the person on reception was not interested, no smile and didn't even ask if everything had been OK. Very poor. I have stayed in may hotels in my time all over the world and this one has to rank as one of the worst for the price paid. We would have been better off staying in the Premier Inn down the road, bigger room, bigger bathroom and a good sized dressing table with mirror and tea & coffee available. Will be staying somewhere else on next visit to London and not recommending this hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:31:20.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
