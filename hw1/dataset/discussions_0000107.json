I had heard about this property from family and decided that it would be a good place for a spring break trip. Their website proclaims \"Book Direct! Best Rate Guarenteed!\" but that apparently does not apply to their lowest advertised rate, which is the Advance Purchase. I booked a double room last week for $281 and checked their site again the next day and the rate had dropped to $269. I waited a few more days and checked Expedia and now the rate is $224. I called them this morning to ask them to honor their best rate guarentee, but they are unwilling to do so. They said it is like the airlines, once booked, it's a done deal... I would never expect the airlines to provide a refund as they do not offer a best rate guarnetee like The Roosevelt does. Other retailers do offer purchase price protection and refund you the difference on a purchase if the price goes down in the first 10-30 days after your purchase. I am afraid this booking experience will now color my entire stay. My adice to you is to not book direct and not book the Advance Purchase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:38:05.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
