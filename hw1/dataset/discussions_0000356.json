We loved the historical grandeur of this hotel and appreciated that many of the features of its heyday have been preserved. The elevators need additional renovation, however, as they take a long time when called and then take their time getting you to your floor. We noticed this was a common frustration amongst many of the other guests, as well. Our room was very run down and lacked any sort of a view, despite being on the 17th floor. We were also very frustrated by the hidden $20/day \"facility' fee. Although we prepaid for our room in full, we were charged this additional fee when we checked out. These fees were not posted when when booked the room, prepaid, or checked into the hotel. The front desk became very defensive and combative when I questioned these fees at check out. I'm not sure I'd stay at the Roosevelt again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-03-29T06:59:55.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
