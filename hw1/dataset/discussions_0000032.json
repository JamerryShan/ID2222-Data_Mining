No coffee maker in my room (with coffee), no mini-fridge to put some water or Poweraid, no complimentary breakfast. I can stay at a Holiday Inn Express or a Hyatt Place or a Drury Inn (favorites) and get a really good free breakfast to fuel me up before a busy day and the rooms are really nice. I don't get it, why so expensive and nothing complimentary. And, I was at an event, The hotel had these nice big open areas by the event, and no couches or lounge chairs or high top tables where people could sit, relax, get some work done, socialize, network and the like, NO, you saw people sitting on the floor. and we had an evening event and ALL of the food was cold. Cold Salmon, Cold Muscles, Cold Beef, Cold Noodles. I just don't get expensive higher end hotels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-03-30T17:49:44.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
