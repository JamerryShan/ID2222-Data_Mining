{"text": "The keyboard i great! It is smooth and silent when using it. The wrist wrest is comfortable and fatigue is next to nothing. The optical switches are great for gaming and while it is not clicky, adjusting to the actuation point is smooth and zero phantom strokes. \nOld and Dirty Room, Uncleaned bathroom, Poor breakfast and a mold smell throughout the hotel. I balked at giving up my old simple kindle."}
