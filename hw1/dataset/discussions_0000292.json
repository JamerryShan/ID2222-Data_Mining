I must say that I was very disappointed... I hardly slept, due to the internal (a permanent rumbling, coming fro heater or AC...) and external (facing the street) noise... I thought my bed was stuck in traffic. Additionally, breakfast is definitively not a the level of the expectations for such a place and price - no hot dishes, for instance... The only positive side was staff who were all very nice and helpful. I was already at that place, few years ago, it's definitively gotten worse ! I surely wonn't go back.\nRoom Tip: Avoid the street side, soundproofing is terrible.
